The plays are performed on an alternating or rotating basis, so from week to week, and even day to day, a different play will be performed. This model is a fairly recent invention in the history of theatre, and while historians aren’t quite sure exactly when this model was created, we can look back to similar models in the Moscow Art Theatre in 1898 and even earlier with state-supported Deutsches Theater in Germany in 1883. UK theatres went through a repertory movement in the early twentieth century, with Miss Annie Horniman founding the first great modern repertory theatre, the Gaeity Theatre in Manchester in 1908 as a way to create quality theatre outside of London, the main metropolitan city.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10">The rep model was created in response to Edwardian theatre, as towns outside of London desired their own theatres. Provincial towns relied on traveling troupes for their theatre needs, so as populations grew in towns like Liverpool and Manchester, a need for their own permanent rep theatres was evident.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10">The modern repertory model is similar to the stock company of actors that arose prior to the Restoration period. Typically in a stock company there were twelve actors including a leading man, a leading woman, and other actors of various shapes, sizes, and character types. As populations began to spread throughout the nineteenth century, these stock companies were replaced by traveling troupes until the time came that the towns they would travel to decided they needed their own theatres. The modern repertory model allows for more equality than the stock company, as an actor who is a leading role in one play may play smaller roles in the others.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10">The first UK rep theatres played short continuous runs, and since the repertory model is expensive to produce, it was not until theatres began to receive state-funding in the 1940s that they saw true rep companies like the state-supported ones in other countries. Among these true rep companies are the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon and London, and the National Theatre Company who are still currently producing theatre.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10">America’s oldest repertory theatre is the Hedgerow Theatre in Rose Valley, Pennyslvania, which was founded by actor Jasper Deeter in 1923. The American repertory movement really gained ground in the 1960s as the Ford Foundation created a &#36;9 million grant to help strengthen regional theatres. At the time, theatre mostly consisted of Broadway and touring Broadway shows, making theatre financially and geographically inaccessible for many. Eventually, Ford Foundation would give &#36;287 million to foster the growth of regional theatres, and with the National Endowment for the Arts founded in 1965, federal subsidies would also assist the growth of art institutions from coast to coast. With funding from both the private and public sectors, the expensive repertory model was employed at many regional theatres, offering long-term homes to creatives and allowing the space to produce more experimental material.</p>    </div>    <button class="pageItem" id="item2086" data-id="2086" name="Button 18" onclick="nav.to(2);" alt="Button 18">      <div class="pageItem state btn-off">        <div id="item675" class="pageItem singleline" alt="BACK TO MENU">          <p class="autoParaStyle15">BACK TO MENU</p>        </div>      </div>    </button>    <button class="pageItem" id="item2080" data-id="2080" name="Button 16" onclick="nav.to(3);" alt="Button 16">      <div class="pageItem state btn-off">        <div id="item723" class="pageItem align-vert" alt="PREVIOUS ARTICLE: RETURN TO REPERTORY">          <div class="valign-center">            <p class="autoParaStyle18">PREVIOUS ARTICLE:</p>            <p class="autoParaStyle17">RETURN TO<br />REPERTORY</p>          </div>        </div>      </div>    </button>    <button class="pageItem" id="item2089" data-id="2089" name="Button 19" onclick="nav.to(1);" alt="Button 19">      <div class="pageItem state btn-off">        <div id="item746" class="pageItem align-vert" alt="NEXT ARTICLE: GETTING TO KNOW: TOPHER EMBREY">          <div class="valign-center">            <p class="autoParaStyle20">NEXT ARTICLE:</p>            <p class="autoParaStyle19">GETTING TO KNOW:<br />TOPHER EMBREY</p>          </div>        </div>      </div>    </button>    <img src="assets/images/item_769.png" class="pageItem" alt="GraphicLine" style="height: 113px !important;left:783px !important;top:3913px !important;" id="item769"/>    <img src="assets/images/item_770.png" class="pageItem" alt="GraphicLine" style="height: 113px !important;left:1137px !important;top:3913px !important;" id="item770"/>    <div id="item794" class="pageItem singleline" alt="ARTSCENTRIC       ARVADA CENTER FOR THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES       WINTER 2022">      <p class="autoParaStyle3">ARTSCENTRIC     |     ARVADA CENTER FOR THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES     |     WINTER 2022</p>    </div>    <div id="item1024" class="pageItem fauxgroup" alt="Rectangle">      <img src="assets/images/49655176088_61380b1325_o.jpg" class="pageItem" alt="Rectangle" style="width:2507px !important;height:1674px !important;left:-294px !important;top:-407px !important;" id="item1097"/>    </div>    <img src="assets/images/item_1028.png" class="pageItem" alt="Rectangle" id="item1028"/>    <img src="assets/images/AC%20Logo.png" class="pageItem" alt="Rectangle" style="width:231px !important;height:59px !important;left:27px !important;top:28px !important;" id="item1035"/>    <img src="assets/images/item_1040.png" class="pageItem" alt="GraphicLine" style="height: 72px !important;left:291px !important;top:24px !important;" id="item1040"/>    <img src="assets/images/item_1042.png" class="pageItem" alt="GraphicLine" style="height: 72px !important;left:1737px !important;top:33px !important;" id="item1042"/>    <div id="item1043" class="pageItem align-vert" alt="INSIDE THE BLACK BOX">      <div class="valign-center">        <p class="autoParaStyle16">INSIDE THE</p>        <p class="autoParaStyle16">BLACK BOX</p>      </div>    </div>    <div id="item1066" class="pageItem singleline align-vert" alt="MENU">      <div class="valign-center">        <p class="autoParaStyle21">MENU</p>      </div>    </div>  </div></div><div id="prefooter" style="float:left;height:1px;">&nbsp;</div></div><div id="in5footer">Built with <a href="http://ajarproductions.com/pages/products/in5/?ref=footer" target="_blank" >In5</a>.</div></div><nav id="page-nav"><button id="nextBtn" name="nextBtn">&nbsp;</button><button id="backBtn" name="backBtn">&nbsp;</button></nav></body></html>
