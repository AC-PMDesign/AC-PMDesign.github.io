Its focus is on the wellbeing of the actor, prioritizing their needs and offering both financial and emotional stability. Actors and crew members alike get to have a long-term contract that keeps them in the same place for several productions. Not only does this create a deeper connection for the actors to the theatre and allow them to really explore their range by shapeshifting into different roles, but it provides them with the opportunity to work enough hours to obtain health insurance coverage from the actors’ union, Actors’ Equity Association. They also get to spend more time doing what they do best - act – rather than spending that time and energy looking for the next gig. By allowing them an opportunity to work rather than look for work, actors are able to live more fulfilling lives with less chance of burnout.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10">Abner Genece is a familiar face to Arvada Center patrons, and has been a member of our repertory company before. “I am absolutely thrilled to return to this organization of talented, passionate artists, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to positively impact this community,” said Abner Genece. “I feel that we are all looking for ways to reconnect. For me, this season represents an exciting pathway toward that goal.”</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10">For Sarah Harmon, this is her first time performing at the Arvada Center and she couldn’t be more excited. “I feel incredibly humbled to work with such a talented and inspiring group of artists,” said Harmon. “I’m so eager to be back in a rehearsal room again. This is my first time working on a production since our industry went into lockdown last year.”</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10">Repertory theatre also allows crew (and in particular set designers) a chance to really grow and push themselves as they not only come up with fantastic set ideas, but ones that are able to adapt and turn into other plays overnight. Everything must be thought of as a whole, from casting and sets, right down to play choices. Repertory theatre is a big challenge, and the Arvada Center Black Box cast and crew handle it with grace.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10">“The biggest challenge – that I’m still in the beginning stages of tackling - is working on multiple plays at once,” said Harmon. “So I definitely feel like my brain is running a memorizing marathon!”</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10">On the other side, patrons get to truly understand just how talented these creatives are as they watch actors go from comic characters to dramatic and back in a short period of time. Our Adopt-an-Actor program is a popular fundraiser where patrons “adopt” one or more actors for the season. True friendships have been built from this program, strengthening the ties to the Center for both our audiences and our creative talent.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10">The Arvada Center produces three-plays with the same evolving cast in each rep season over the course of several months. This year’s rep season contains Stick Fly, a play with a predominantly BIPOC cast. This influenced our repertory company of actors to be the most diverse in our history, as well as having a BIPOC director for the first time with Jada Suzanne Dixon, director of Stick Fly. By choosing a diverse play first, we were able to ensure a diverse cast, helping to strengthen our IDEA (inclusion, diversity, equity, access) initiative and cultivating more diversity in our workforce and on our stages.</p>      <p class="autoParaStyle10"><br /></p>      <p class="autoParaStyle9"><span class="autoCharStyle1">When planning our theatre season, we take calculated risks with our Black Box play selections. With the rep held in our smaller 200-seat Black Box Theatre, we explore and produce more experimental works as well as commission new works from local writers. Where our Main Stage musicals intend more to entertain, the Black Box challenges. Thought-provoking subject matter is gone into further detail through post-performance talkbacks where actors and creative staff answer audience questions about various elements of the production. “This season offers a reflection of, and a response to, some of the issues that we as a society are currently engaged in. We have the opportunity to continue the conversation in a thoughtful way, which I hope will lead to positive action,” said Genece.</span></p>    </div>    <button class="pageItem" id="item2075" data-id="2075" name="Button 15" onclick="nav.to(2);" alt="Button 15">      <div class="pageItem state btn-off">        <div id="item350" class="pageItem singleline" alt="BACK TO MENU">          <p class="autoParaStyle15">BACK TO MENU</p>        </div>      </div>    </button>    <img src="assets/images/item_360.png" class="pageItem" alt="GraphicLine" style="height: 72px !important;left:291px !important;top:24px !important;" id="item360"/>    <img src="assets/images/item_1015.png" class="pageItem" alt="GraphicLine" style="height: 72px !important;left:1737px !important;top:33px !important;" id="item1015"/>    <div id="item382" class="pageItem align-vert" alt="INSIDE THE BLACK BOX">      <div class="valign-center">        <p class="autoParaStyle16">INSIDE THE</p>        <p class="autoParaStyle16">BLACK BOX</p>      </div>    </div>    <div id="item408" class="pageItem align-vert" alt="PREVIOUS ARTICLE: TITLE TITLE TITLE">      <div class="valign-center">        <p class="autoParaStyle18">PREVIOUS ARTICLE:</p>        <p class="autoParaStyle17">TITLE TITLE<br />TITLE</p>      </div>    </div>    <button class="pageItem" id="item2071" data-id="2071" name="Button 13" onclick="nav.to(4);" alt="Button 13">      <div class="pageItem state btn-off">        <div id="item413" class="pageItem align-vert" alt="NEXT ARTICLE: WHAT IS REPERTORY THEATRE ">          <div class="valign-center">            <p class="autoParaStyle20">NEXT ARTICLE:</p>            <p class="autoParaStyle19">WHAT IS<br />REPERTORY</p>            <p class="autoParaStyle19">THEATRE?</p>          </div>        </div>      </div>    </button>    <img src="assets/images/item_438.png" class="pageItem" alt="GraphicLine" style="height: 113px !important;left:783px !important;top:4397px !important;" id="item438"/>    <img src="assets/images/item_440.png" class="pageItem" alt="GraphicLine" style="height: 113px !important;left:1137px !important;top:4397px !important;" id="item440"/>    <button class="pageItem" id="item2060" data-id="2060" name="Button 10" onclick="nav.to(2);" alt="Button 10">      <div class="pageItem state btn-off">        <div id="item573" class="pageItem singleline align-vert" alt="MENU">          <div class="valign-center">            <p class="autoParaStyle21">MENU</p>          </div>        </div>      </div>    </button>    <div id="item619" class="pageItem singleline" alt="ARTSCENTRIC       ARVADA CENTER FOR THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES       WINTER 2022">      <p class="autoParaStyle3">ARTSCENTRIC     |     ARVADA CENTER FOR THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES     |     WINTER 2022</p>    </div>  </div></div><div id="prefooter" style="float:left;height:1px;">&nbsp;</div></div><div id="in5footer">Built with <a href="http://ajarproductions.com/pages/products/in5/?ref=footer" target="_blank" >In5</a>.</div></div><nav id="page-nav"><button id="nextBtn" name="nextBtn">&nbsp;</button><button id="backBtn" name="backBtn">&nbsp;</button></nav></body></html>
